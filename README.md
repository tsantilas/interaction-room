## intro
Welcome to the Interaction Room! This is an interactive scene I created in Unity,<i> actually my very first project on this journey</i>, with simple assets (animations, objects, materials) made completely by me in order to showcase some basic features.

## extensive description
The interaction starts outside the room. The player (a capsule - sike) spawns outside the room facing a closed door. Once he moves closer to the door a message pops up on the screen saying "INTERACT [F]" and he's able to open the door by using the interact button.
The room is divided by two red walls to make the showcase of the interactions easier.

On the first side there is a light switch (button) and a light. Once the player decides to interact with the button (the same way he did with the door) the light will be activated.

The other side of the room is being surveilled by a CCTV. The moment that the player steps inside that area the CCTV will begin following him and a message will pop up in the middle of the screen saying "YOU ARE BEING WATCHED" as the camera follows his movement.
